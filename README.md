Projects within this Repo is done by me for my own pleasure

Bunny Hunters: It is a Java extended Applet game built like an original arcade game with powerups. The Objective is to shoot the enemies while trying to survive.

Pong: A Unity-built 3D version of Pong.

Jump King: A Unity-built jumping game based on the original Jump King, but converted for mobile devices. At the moment, the game has two levels, but will probably be expanded and assets will change as time progress.
